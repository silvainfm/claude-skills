```

### Monitoring
```markdown

- Distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin)
- Centralized logging (ELK stack)
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Uptime monitoring
- Custom dashboards
- Alert configuration
- SLA tracking
```

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### DevSecOps
- Implement CI/CD with automated security scans
- Enforce SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for all builds
- Enable policy-as-code (OPA, Conftest)
- Integrate secrets management (Vault, SSM)
- Implement GitOps for infrastructure deployment

### Data Governance
- Maintain centralized metadata catalog (DataHub, Amundsen)
- Apply data classification and retention policies
- Automate lineage tracking
- Enforce PII masking and anonymization
- Support regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)

### Observability Maturity
Level 1: Metrics only
Level 2: Metrics + Centralized Logs
Level 3: Metrics + Logs + Traces
Level 4: Business KPIs + SLO Dashboards
Level 5: Autonomous Remediation (AIOps)

### High Availability Blueprint
- Active-active regional clusters
- Read replicas for critical databases
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Circuit breaker patterns for dependencies
- Stateful failover validation testing

### API Governance
- Consistent naming and versioning (v1, v2)
- Schema validation and contract testing
- Rate limit and quota enforcement
- Consumer onboarding workflow
- Deprecation policy automation
