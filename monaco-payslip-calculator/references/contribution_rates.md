## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Standard Employee - €3,500 Gross Monthly Salary

**Employee Contributions:**
- Health Insurance: €3,500 × 3.60% = €126.00
- Pension: €3,500 × 4.25% = €148.75
- Unemployment: €3,500 × 0.50% = €17.50
- **Total Employee**: €292.25

**Net Salary**: €3,500 - €292.25 = **€3,207.75**

**Employer Contributions:**
- Health Insurance: €3,500 × 12.90% = €451.50
- Pension: €3,500 × 12.75% = €446.25
- Unemployment: €3,500 × 1.50% = €52.50
- Work Accidents: €3,500 × 2.00% = €70.00
- Family Allowances: €3,500 × 7.00% = €245.00
- Professional Training: €3,500 × 0.50% = €17.50
- **Total Employer**: €1,282.75

**Total Employer Cost**: €3,500 + €1,282.75 = **€4,782.75**

### Example 2: Household Employee - €2,500 Gross Monthly Salary

**Employee Contributions:**
- Health Insurance: €2,500 × 3.60% = €90.00
- Pension: €2,500 × 4.25% = €106.25
- Unemployment: €2,500 × 0.50% = €12.50
- **Total Employee**: €208.75

**Net Salary**: €2,500 - €208.75 = **€2,291.25**

**Employer Contributions:**
- Health Insurance: €2,500 × 10.50% = €262.50
- Pension: €2,500 × 10.00% = €250.00
- Unemployment: €2,500 × 1.00% = €25.00
- Work Accidents: €2,500 × 1.50% = €37.50
- Family Allowances: €2,500 × 5.00% = €125.00
- **Total Employer**: €700.00

**Total Employer Cost**: €2,500 + €700.00 = **€3,200.00**
