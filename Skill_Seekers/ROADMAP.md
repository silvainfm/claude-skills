# Skill Seeker Development Roadmap

## Vision
Transform Skill Seeker into the easiest way to create Claude AI skills from **any knowledge source** - documentation websites, PDFs, codebases, GitHub repos, Office docs, and more - with both CLI and MCP interfaces.

## 🎯 New Approach: Flexible, Incremental Development

**Philosophy:** Small tasks → Pick one → Complete → Move on

Instead of rigid milestones, we now use a **flexible task-based approach**:
- 100+ small, independent tasks across 10 categories
- Pick any task, any order
- Start small, ship often
- No deadlines, just continuous progress

**See:** [FLEXIBLE_ROADMAP.md](FLEXIBLE_ROADMAP.md) for the complete task list!
